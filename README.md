# Intrusion-Detection-System
• Simulated an IoT environment with NODE MCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensors, and a wireless router.  
• Implemented an adversarial system for sniffing and poisoning attacks.  
• Captured and labeled sensor data during normal and attack phases.  
• Achieved a high accuracy of 93% using Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
